# Graphs

A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

## Challenge

Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:

1. add node
   Arguments: value
   Returns: The added node
   Add a node to the graph

2. add edge
   Arguments: 2 nodes to be connected by the edge, weight (optional)
   Returns: nothing
   Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
   If specified, assign a weight to the edge
   Both nodes should already be in the Graph

3. get nodes
   Arguments: none
   Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar).

4. get neighbors
   Arguments: node
   Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node

5. size
   Arguments: none
   Returns the total number of nodes in the graph

## Approach & Efficiency
Big O
1. add node
   time o(1)
   space o(n)

2. add edge
   time o(1)
   space o(1)

3. get nodes
   time o(1)
   space o(n)

4. get neighbors
   time o(1) no looping
   space o(n)

5. size
   time o(1) no looping
   space o(1) no array

## API

1. add node
   add node to graph

2. add edge
   add edge between tow nodes

3. get nodes
   Returns all of the nodes in the graph

4. get neighbors

get a collection of edges connected to the given node.

5. size

get the total number of nodes in the graph.
