## Binary search

### Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and a value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Approach & Efficiency

#### we first gonna detect first and last item in an sorted array
and then find the middle item and look if its bigger or smaller than it ,if bigger gonna find the middle between the last and the mid other wise gonna find bwetween first and mid and so on tell i find the item 

### Big-O 

#### time O(log n) 

### space O(n)
